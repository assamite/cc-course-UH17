<h1>2. Course Format<a class="headerlink" href="#course-format" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The course in given in two parts. First part consists of lectures, discussion
sections and individual assignments. Second part is a small project. Course will
also have a take home exam which students take towards the end of the course.</p>
<div class="section" id="first-part-weekly-format">
<h2>2.1. First Part - Weekly format<a class="headerlink" href="#first-part-weekly-format" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The first part lasts the first 4-5 weeks of the course. In this part we will have
three sessions per week (Monday, Wednesday and Friday) and one deadline (Sun 23.55)
per week.</p>
<p>The weekly schedule is as follows.
On Mondays, we will introduce a new topic in a lecture like session. We
continue to work on the topic on Wednesday, when students have read an article
about the topic (see below). Sessions on Wednesday consist partly from lectures
and partly from more relaxed discussion, group work, etc.. Friday’s sessions are meant to be
workshop-like sessions where students can work on their weekly exercises
(see below). None of the sessions are compulsory, however, you will get course
points from attending Monday’s and Wednesday’s sessions.</p>
<p>Each week we will have an article to be read and a set of assignments.</p>
<p>Assignments consist of programming, mathematical and other practical work.
Their deadline is on Sunday 23.55 every week, and they are revealed latest on
Monday of the same week.</p>
<p>The <em>coding</em> exercises should be returned as a compressed
file (zip, tar.gz) that extracts to a folder containing the exercise code
and other documentation. <strong>The folder has to be named with your UH username!</strong>
If there is any possibility for misinterpretation, add a README file explaining
the file(s) associated with each exercise.</p>
<p>The <em>written</em> assignments are returned separately through Moodle.</p>
<p>Following, is the coarse explanation for the weekly schedule:</p>

<h3>2.2.1. Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The second part of the course consists of group projects and lectures. The group projects are
done in groups of 2-3 persons.
There is a weekly deadline on Wednesdays where the groups
informally present their work so far and on the last week there is <em>a demo session</em> which
is compulsory for all the students. On the week of 100th Finnish independence day,
the deadline is on Thursday.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Rough schedule:</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last simple">
<li>Wed 22.11. Formation of groups, groups have their members listed and an initial topic idea (domain, etc.) on Moodle</li>
<li>Wed 29.11. Group topics fixed, group topic and repository link on Moodle</li>
<li>Thu 7.12. Update on group’s situation on Moodle</li>
<li>Wed 13.12. Demo session and last update on Moodle</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>On each Moodle update, state clearly what each group member has done towards the
project after the last Moodle update. On the last Moodle update (Wed 13.12.),
also give a summary of everybody’s work towards the whole project.</p>

<div class="section" id="topic">
<h3>2.2.2. Topic<a class="headerlink" href="#topic" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The group project’s topic may be any creative software. You can continue to work
on the poem system, reuse some of the code from the course or start a whole new
project (or take some other code base as a starting point for you project). The
main goal is to build a creative system! Do not make too ambitious plans, instead,
focus on simple implementations that will maximize your system’s creativity. That is,
proof-of-concept systems are welcome. Your system should demonstrate some creative mechanism(s), that
potentially could be enhanced e.g. by learning some models from larger data sets,
or utilizing more expert knowledge in its decision making.</p>
<p>The system must be original (do not just copy some example system from an article, etc.),
and the group’s own contributions to the code base must be clearly stated.</p>

<div class="section" id="grading">
<h3>2.2.3. Grading<a class="headerlink" href="#grading" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>The project is graded based on:</dt>
<dd><ol class="first last arabic simple">
<li>the observed and described creativity (process and output) of the system,</li>
<li>light weight documentation, and</li>
<li>quality of the code.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The creativity of the system is mainly graded based on the group’s weekly reports
and especially the demo session. Light weight documentation considers the running
instructions and a brief description of the system’s design. Quality of the code
involves overall nice architecture, and <em>descriptive function and
module documentation</em>. The weights of these three parts are approx. 66% for the
first part and 33% divided for the last two parts. The individual’s ability to
contribute to the group project is reflected on the individual grades.</p>

<h2>2.4. Grading<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The course is graded based on deliverables from both parts and doing a take home
exam towards the end of the course. On the first part, students get course points
from returned exercises, and participation at the discussion sessions
(Wednesdays). On the second part, students get course points from the returned
group work. The first and second part are weighted so that the full points will give
30% of the maximum course points from each. The take home exam will give the rest of the
points (40%). However, as the exam will have also questions about the group project,
the actual weight of the project will be higher.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
